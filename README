1 ... Project Description
=========================

This is a GUI AlarmClock application implementing two independent alarms. Each alarm can be set to 'Alarm At', eg 13:15, or 'Alarm In', eg 1 hour 10 mins. Each alarm also incorporates a 'Snooze' button that will pause a ringing alarm for 5 minutes.

---------------------

2 ... This Repository
=====================

AlarmClock is written as a NetBeans Java project and as such the files tracked by Git are determined by NetBeans.

------------------

3 ... Installation
==================

As a Java application it can run on many operating systems so this repository does not include any specific installation support. Other projects / repositories listed below provide installation packages although the list begins with just using the compiled jar from this repository.

A) The compiled jar file AlarmClock.jar can be found in the dist folder of this repository. This file can be copied to a target machine and run using the command:
java -jar "/YourPath/AlarmClock.jar"

B) An associated GitHub repository AlarmClockAutoToolsDist is available. This repository provides an installation mechanism for any system supporting the AutoTools tool-chain, eg Linux.

C) Another associated GitHub repository AlarmClockWindowsDist will be available shortly. This repository provides the mechanism to produce a Windows msi installer package.

D) A PPA (Personal Package Archive) is also available on LaunchPad which provides a neat mechanism for installing AlarmClock and keeping it up-to-date on Ubuntu. The PPA resides on LaunchPad here:
